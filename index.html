          <p>I accompany people who are in transition, not to guide them somewhere, but just to be there while they figure it out themselves. I have spent years learning that most of my struggles came from trying to fix things, control everything, become something.</p>

          <p>I built software for most of my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/romansbermans/" target="_blank">professional</a> life. I am present now. I listen. I see people as they are. Sometimes that is enough for something to shift. Sometimes it is not, and that is fine too.</p>

          <p>You might be navigating a career change, a question of meaning, or simply a feeling that something needs to settle but you do not know what. You do not need to have it figured out. We meet online or in person in Barcelona. You share what is.</p>

          <p>After we meet, you decide what to offer. A "thank you", €1, €10, €100, or whatever feels right. This is an experiment in how support can work outside traditional structures.</p>
